This is the Github repository for the Coursera course 'Getting and Cleaning Data' project.

This project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in collecting, manipulating and cleaning a data set, with the goal of preparing a tidy data for further analysis.

This submission includes:
- a tidy data set
- a script for performing the required analysis (run_analysis.R)
- a code book that describes the the data and how it was cleaned up
- a README.md that explains how the project was carried out

Data source

"One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone."

Data Analysis

The script run_analysis.R meets the ff. project requirements:
- create one data set from the training and test sets
- extract mean and standard deviation records for each measurement
- assign descriptive activity names
- label the data set with descriptive variable names.
- create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
